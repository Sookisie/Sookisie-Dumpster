## About Me

Currently a Year 2 Computer Science student who is on a verge of a mental breakdown due to study progress achieving 90% confusion state. Personal Record!

Im kidding, lol (or not)

I am actually:
Passionate in LLM, Design, and computer vision. (Like, for real)

I specialize in:
- Asking ChatGpt and proceed to verbally abuse it when it doesn't give me a preferred answer
- Spamming herbal tea filled with sugar when sprinting through a project
- Live-Laugh-Loving throughout my entire student journey

Currently:
- Procrastinating setting up my github and linkin (I will actually fully set it up one day.. i think)
- Actually fist-fighting with OpenCV while cheating on Tensorflow with YOLO
- Poorly fixing my sleeping schedule after a 35 hour speedrun

What I lack in sleep, I make up for in last-minute solutions with the help of AI
